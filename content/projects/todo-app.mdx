Just a simple to-do app I made following a tutorial, to help me understand the basics of React.

## Following are the basic react concepts I used for it.

- Basic React Hooks like UseEffect and UseState.
- Refactoring the app into smaller components. 
- Sharing data between components using Props. 

The source code for the components can be found in the components/todo-app folder in the
